# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Main tasks before release
- Open app at startup [check this](https://codedotspirit.dev/blog/Starting%20an%20Electron%20app%20on%20System%20Boot)
- Start at backup at midday
- If app wasn't open last midday, start a backup
- Create a nice README.md
- Advertise to notion communities
