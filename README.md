# Notion Vault

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Main tasks before release
- If app wasn't open last midday, start a backup
- Update installed app name (for the moment this is the package name)
- Update installed app logo
- Create a nice README.md
- Advertise to notion communities
