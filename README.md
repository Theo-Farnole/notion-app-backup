# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Main tasks before release
- ADD recurrent backup system when app is opened
- Open app at startup
- Create backend server to /login/:code
- Create a nice README.md + Move remaining tasks into issues
- Advertise to notion communities
