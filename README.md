# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## The next micro tasks

- ADD progression feedback when manual backup btn is pressed
- ADD backup history in "backup details" page
- ADD recurrent backup system when app is opened
- Open app at startup
- Handle workspace with no icon
- Allow backup path changing
- Add "open in explorer" button in "backup details" page
- Add lastest backup recap in "backup details" page
- Save in markdown or html (instead of .json)
