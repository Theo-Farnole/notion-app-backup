# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Roadmap

[x] mockup page: create new backup page  
[x] page: settings (set notion API key)  
[x] Persistence of backup (create new backup, load existing backups)  
[ ] page | backup details | Delete backup button  
[ ] page | backup details | Manual backup button  
[ ] Backup system   
[ ] Securized notion API saving
