I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## The next micro taskss

- API exportSpace mockup with OAuth (maybe, we will need a backend server)
- ADD manual backup button in "backup details" page
- ADD recurrent backup system when app is opened
- Open app at startup
- Handle workspace with no icon
