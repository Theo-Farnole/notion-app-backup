# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Main tasks before release
- Start at backup at midday
- If app wasn't open last midday, start a backup
- Create backend server to /login/:code
- Open app at startup
- Create a nice README.md
- Advertise to notion communities
