# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Roadmap

☑️ mockup page: create new backup page  
☑️ page: settings (set notion API key)  
☑️ Persistence of backup (create new backup, load existing backups)  
☑️ page | backup details | Delete backup button  
⬜ page | backup details | Manual backup button  
⬜ Backup system   
⬜ Securized notion API saving
