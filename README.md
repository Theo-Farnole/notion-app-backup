# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Main tasks before release
- Start at backup at midday [check this](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/schedule-repetitive-tasks-in-node-js-3bef27515ce5)
- If app wasn't open last midday, start a backup
- Create a nice README.md
- Advertise to notion communities
