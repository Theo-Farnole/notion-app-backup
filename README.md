# Notion App Backup

I am building a desktop app to make local backups of my notion.so workspaces.

## Todo

[ ] Front-end Mockup  
&emsp;[x] page: create new backup page  
&emsp;[ ] page: backup details (delete, rename, change backup frequency)  
&emsp;[ ] page: settings (set notion API key)  
[x] Persistence of backup (create new backup, load existing backups)  
[ ] Backup system 
[ ] Securized notion API saving
